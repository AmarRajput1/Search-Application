# Search-Application
Technical test response - an application to search data

This application has been programmed using c# as a visual studio windows forms project

The main aim of this application is to be able to search through an excel file and an SQL database and return results based on pre-determined search criteria. The results of the search then populate a data grid view.

An example excel file has been included in the bin/debug folder (Data.xlsx)

An example schema has been included in the uppermost folder of the application to create the same data table in SQL management studio. The database is named 'SearchResults' and the table is named 'ResultsTable'. Please feel free to change the connection string in accordance with new settings defined in line 21 of frmSearch.cs
